# OMH-native Hermes Agent model calibration benchmark

`omh_live_model_tool_benchmark/v1` compares baseline and model-family-calibrated
OMH prompts on a pinned synthetic coding corpus.

The live path measures the product under test:

1. resolve the selected model through `omh coding model-route`;
2. build baseline and optimized prompts from the same task, adding only the
   calibration selected by `unit_prompt_protocol.py`;
3. dispatch through the explicit
   `omh coding hermes-child dispatch --confirm-dispatch` boundary;
4. grade the final workspace and machine answer with controller-only validators;
5. read tool, token, and cost metrics from authenticated
   `routing_observation/v1` evidence.

There is no OMO execution path. OMH remains Hermes-native: core OMH makes no
provider call, and the explicit benchmark command launches the local Hermes CLI
under the existing isolated child-process contract.

There are two explicit live execution paths:

- `omh` preserves the official isolated `omh coding hermes-child dispatch`
  contract. It deliberately cannot read the caller's Hermes profile credentials.
- `hermes_current_session` invokes `hermes --oneshot` with the current Hermes
  configuration, so a model already authenticated in that profile can run. It is
  explicitly labeled `hermes_current_session` in every run artifact and does
  not use the isolated child boundary.

Both paths use the same pinned corpus and controller-only validators. In either
case prompts are passed only on stdin, temporary usage telemetry is discarded
once scalar observed tool/token/cost metrics are recorded, and raw prompts,
stdout, stderr, credentials, and config content are never persisted.

## Safety and claim boundary

- `fake` is the default offline harness.
- `omh` requires `--allow-paid-live`; it can trigger paid provider calls through
  the local Hermes CLI.
- Prompts are sent over stdin and are never persisted by OMH.
- Missing token or cost telemetry stays `null`; the benchmark never estimates it.
- A completed child process is not a passing task. Controller-only semantic
  validators determine pass/fail.
- Results describe the pinned corpus, OMH version, Hermes version, model IDs, and
  conditions only. They do not establish universal model superiority.

## Commands

```bash
python benchmarks/live-model-tools/v1/bench.py doctor
python benchmarks/live-model-tools/v1/bench.py corpus --verify
python benchmarks/live-model-tools/v1/bench.py smoke

# Explicit paid live smoke (isolated official child):
python benchmarks/live-model-tools/v1/bench.py smoke \
  --harness omh \
  --model qwen3-coder-next \
  --condition optimized \
  --allow-paid-live \
  --max-paid-calls 1

# Current-profile live smoke (models authenticated in this Hermes config):
python benchmarks/live-model-tools/v1/bench.py smoke \
  --harness hermes_current_session \
  --model moonshotai/kimi-k3-ultrafast \
  --current-session-provider kimi_k3 \
  --condition optimized \
  --allow-paid-live \
  --max-paid-calls 1
```

`--current-session-provider` is only for `hermes_current_session`: use it when
the active Hermes profile registered the selected model under a local custom
provider ID (for example, `kimi_k3`) that differs from the manifest's provider.
It never changes the isolated `omh` harness. A failed live invocation still
writes a metadata-only record with a redacted failure classification and receipt;
raw stdout, stderr, prompts, credentials, and config remain unpersisted.

Run baseline and optimized matrices separately so every condition uses the same
pinned instances. A third condition, `family`, sends the block the model would
inherit from its family with any exact-model override skipped; it exists so an
override (for example `gpt-6-astra` over the `gpt` block) is measured against
what it replaced and not only against no calibration. Pair it with `analyze.py
--baseline-condition family` so the override is the `optimized` side:

```bash
python benchmarks/live-model-tools/v1/bench.py run \
  --harness omh --condition baseline --allow-paid-live --max-paid-calls 240
python benchmarks/live-model-tools/v1/bench.py run \
  --harness omh --condition optimized --allow-paid-live --max-paid-calls 240
```

The manifest currently covers Qwen3-Coder, current DeepSeek, and GLM agent
routes in addition to the existing comparison families. Prompt controls are
version-aware:

- Qwen3-Coder is treated as a non-thinking coding-agent model.
- DeepSeek preserves the distinction between current thinking-mode models and
  legacy R1 guidance.
- GLM can benefit from interleaved reasoning between tool results when the
  Hermes/provider contract exposes and preserves that context.

Provider parameters are not claimed unless Hermes actually exposes them and the
observation records them.

## Latest measured status

The 2026-08-13 evaluation run completed the full offline fake matrix:

| Harness | Condition | Passed | Scheduled | Delta |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `fake` | baseline | 30 | 30 | |
| `fake` | optimized | 30 | 30 | `0.0` |

This proves the pinned corpus, controller validators, pairing, analysis, and
audit pipeline execute end to end. It is not model-performance evidence.

### 2026-08-14 `hermes_current_session` live evaluation

Live runs through the `hermes_current_session` path on the pinned evaluation
corpus (30 instances, digest
`c4ea899a8e727fcc531776e56306ff0e83d129e2248fe4362614b3d186fa7b33`). Only
validator passes count as success. These results are separate from, and must
not be mixed with, the official isolated `omh` child harness.

| Model | Condition | Passed | Total tokens |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| GPT-5.6 Sol (`openai-codex`) | baseline | 17 / 30 | 1,919,268 |
| GPT-5.6 Sol (`openai-codex`) | optimized | 17 / 30 | 1,896,666 |
| Kimi K3 ultrafast (`moonshotai/kimi-k3-ultrafast`) | baseline | 11 / 30 | 2,196,714 |
| Kimi K3 ultrafast (`moonshotai/kimi-k3-ultrafast`) | optimized | 10 / 30 | 1,959,490 |
| GLM 5.2 ultrafast (`z-ai/glm-5.2-ultrafast`) | baseline | 14 / 30 | 2,340,947 |
| GLM 5.2 ultrafast (`z-ai/glm-5.2-ultrafast`) | optimized | 13 / 30 | 2,416,909 |

Per-class pass counts (out of 3 instances each):

Kimi K3 ultrafast and GLM 5.2 ultrafast were served through
[OpenGateway](https://opengateway.ai/) — one API for every LLM, built for
production — via the local `kimi_k3` provider registration. Claude Fable 5 was
not measured: the profile's Anthropic OAuth credential was rejected by the
provider with "Third-party apps now draw from your extra usage" (HTTP 400) and
no extra-usage credit was available. The local SGLang GLM proxy
(`HERMES_CUSTOM_SGLANG_PROXY_API_KEY`) was also unusable (HTTP 401 invalid API
key), so GLM ran through OpenGateway instead.

Two earlier GPT-5.6 Sol baseline attempts on the same day are invalid and
excluded: the first (30 runs, 0/30) passed the task on stdin, which
`hermes --oneshot` does not read, so the model never saw the task; the second
(30 runs, 2/30) leaked the caller's `TERMINAL_CWD` into the child, so the
model read and mutated files in the user's home directory instead of the
benchmark workspace. Both defects were harness bugs, not model results; the
records are kept as `*-invalid-stdin.jsonl` and `*-invalid-cwd.jsonl` for
audit only.

Harness corrections made for this measurement (benchmark correctness only):
`.py` launchers now run under the current interpreter on every platform, the
oneshot prompt is passed as the flag's argument with `--in <workspace>` and a
workspace-pinned `TERMINAL_CWD`, and tool byproducts (`.venv`, `.pytest_cache`,
`__pycache__`, `uv.lock`, symlinks) no longer count as model mutations.

Results describe this pinned corpus, OMH version, Hermes version, model IDs,
and conditions only. They do not establish universal model superiority.

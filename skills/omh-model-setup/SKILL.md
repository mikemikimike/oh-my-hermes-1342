# Model Setup

This is a Hermes-native `model-setup` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`model-setup` exists to turn local model history into a safe, user-confirmed activation flow: Hermes retains native aliases and providers, Maestro remains an external-handoff coordinator, and editable recommendations can fall through missing preferred models without turning metadata into availability or execution claims.

## Do Not Use When

- The user is asking which model Hermes currently is, not asking to inspect, change, connect, or route one.
- The request needs a repository code change rather than local model setup or recommendation review.
- The user wants anti-ban, cooldown-bypass, hidden retry, benchmark-superiority, or provider-entitlement claims.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: Set up models from what I already have; only Qwen and Gemini are active, and show me the Hermes versus external-owner changes before applying anything.
- Expected behavior: Inspect safe metadata, ask the user to confirm active candidates, keep unavailable preferred heads visible, resolve compatible fallbacks, and separately preview Hermes-native config and Maestro external-handoff guidance.
- Why: The request needs flexible missing-model resolution while preserving owner and approval boundaries.

Bad example:

- Prompt: Use an old session entry to prove my Grok account is active and silently replace the main alias.
- Expected behavior: Treat the entry as observed_before only, require active confirmation, show any alias collision, and refuse an unapproved write.
- Why: Historical metadata is not provider readiness and cannot authorize a configuration change.

## Completion Checklist

- If a prerequisite is unmet, mark that item "not applicable" and continue with the rest of the guide instead of blocking or guessing.
- Success is applicable-only: verification passes when every applicable item is confirmed complete, not when every possible item exists.
- Every emitted metadata identifier passed the safe allowlist and every candidate retains a closed source state.
- Hermes-native configuration and Maestro external-handoff recommendations are reported as separate owner surfaces.
- Every requested write was previewed, explicitly approved, digest-checked, and re-verified; unresolved model items did not block unrelated setup.

## Recovery Notes

- If discovery is absent, truncated, unreadable, or layout_unverified, name that source state and continue with manual confirmed-active input instead of scanning more broadly.
- If a preferred Kimi, Claude, OpenAI, GLM, Grok, Gemini, or Qwen candidate is missing, preserve it as inactive and try the next confirmed-active compatible editorial candidate; do not substitute for an explicit unavailable choice.
- If no compatible model is confirmed active, leave the recommendation unconfigured, finish applicable OMH setup, and name the relevant Hermes-native provider/auth or user-override next action.
- If the diagnosed Hermes config cannot be read, report the read failure and stop before proposing a diff; if the config digest changes or the user rejects the diff, do not apply it.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `buzz`, `agent-board`, `gateway-intent-card`, `+34 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `oh-my-hermes` or name the adjacent workflow.

## Use When

Use when the user wants Hermes to inspect metadata-only model history, confirm active models, configure Hermes-native role aliases or providers, review editable recommendations for an external coding handoff, or switch a session model through the prerequisite-check, diagnose, guide, diff-approved apply, and verify contract.

    Strong routing signals: `model-setup`, `hermes model setup`, `set up my models`, `set up my model`, `configure my models`, `configure model provider`, `connect my model provider`, `set up model role slots`, `switch my session model`, `모델 설정 도와줘`, `모델 설정`, `모델 연결`, `모델 프로바이더 설정`, `모델 슬롯 설정`

Quality bar:

- Prerequisite check: confirm the subscription, account, or capability the step needs exists before continuing; mark unmet prerequisites "not applicable" and skip them explicitly.
- Read-only diagnose: inspect only allowlisted Hermes config metadata, provider plugin/auth presence, aliases, and the installed version; never read dotenv files, credential material, or secret values.
- Guide: direct the user to Hermes-native account, OAuth, or token flows they complete themselves; never ask them to paste secrets into chat.
- Diff-approved apply: show the exact non-secret Hermes config command or alias preview and apply only after the user explicitly approves it; never edit dotenv files or credential material.
- Verify: re-inspect the allowlisted Hermes config metadata and report a completion checklist covering every applicable item.
- Treat each Hermes role slot (main, realtime-search, design), semantic category, and external owner as an independent prerequisite/diagnose/recommend/apply unit instead of one combined change.
- Explain the shipped recommendations as editable editorial defaults, not benchmarks or allowlists: ultrabrain uses GPT-5.6 Sol, deep uses GPT-5.6 Terra, unspecified-high prefers Kimi K3 then Claude Opus 5, unspecified-low prefers GLM-5.2 then GLM-5.2 Ultrafast, and visual-engineering prefers Claude Fable 5 then Kimi K3; quick, writing, and artistry may remain unconfigured.
- For X/Twitter scraping or trend analysis, keep x_platform_data as a domain affinity rather than a role alias: prefer confirmed-active Grok, then Kimi K3, then Gemini, without removing the rest of the route or overriding an explicit model.
- When a recommendation head is missing, choose the first confirmed-active owner-compatible fallback; when no candidate is active, leave that item unconfigured and let the rest of OMH setup finish.
- Give provider-specific native next actions without claiming provider readiness: use installed Hermes flows for OpenAI OAuth/OpenAI Codex, Anthropic or an existing Claude provider, Qwen OAuth or Alibaba, Gemini/Google/Vertex, Grok/xAI, Kimi, GLM/Z.AI, or an already-working custom provider; preserve working alternatives.

Handoff policy:

Keep Hermes-native model setup in Hermes: inspect its config, provider plugins, auth presence, and aliases, then use Hermes-native config/auth flows for an approved change. Maestro coordinates prepared external coding handoffs for Codex, Claude Code, OMO/OMC/OMX, and generic owners; it is not an executor and never owns Hermes aliases, providers, skill execution, or Kanban model selection. Diagnosis uses local Hermes config/auth commands and reads only config plus auth/plugin presence; it never reads `.env` values, credential material, or session prose. Show the exact Hermes-native command/config preview, bind it to the inspected config digest, and apply only after explicit approval; verify by re-inspecting Hermes state. A prepared Hermes binding or Maestro handoff is not model invocation, dispatch, or execution evidence.

Required inputs:

- metadata-only discovery report and its source/candidate states
- user confirmation of which discovered models and providers are currently active
- target Hermes role alias (main, realtime-search, or design), semantic category, X-platform domain, or external coding owner
- optional user-edited recommendation overrides

Expected outputs:

- source-labeled candidate inventory separating historical observation from confirmed-active models
- editable editorial recommendation chains resolved only against confirmed-active compatible candidates
- Hermes-native alias/provider preview or a separate Maestro ordered external-handoff recommendation
- verification checklist or an incomplete non-blocking setup advisory with exact next actions

Artifact expectations:

- model_discovery/v1 metadata-only report when local discovery runs
- model_recommendation_resolution/v1 recommendation result when a chain is resolved
- omh_model_activation/v1 setup receipt when the setup surface captures it

Safety rules:

- Treat session and config stores as untrusted metadata sources. Read only allowlisted provider, model, variant, timestamp, and source identifiers; never read or emit transcript prose, prompts, tool results, credentials, token values, entitlement, or quota.
- Keep discovery states closed and explicit: recommended, observed_before, confirmed_active, inactive, unobserved, and truncated; report an unknown OMP layout as layout_unverified. Historical observed_before metadata is not active-model confirmation.
- Preserve explicit model choices. If an explicitly requested model is unavailable, return choice_required instead of silently substituting another candidate.
- Do not add a second Hermes provider registry, edit Hermes YAML directly, invoke a model, contact a provider, or run network readiness probes from OMH core.
- CCAPI and Apitopia are editorial provider-family preferences only, not observed availability, entitlement, or credential evidence. Do not promise anti-ban behavior, cooldown bypasses, hidden retries, or provider-specific superiority.
- Keep prerequisite check, diagnosis, guidance, apply, and verify as separate, explicit steps.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `coding-handling`.

```sh
omh runtime record --skill model-setup --harness coding-handling --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared OMH routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.

Use Hermes-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.

"""Scheduling for memory consolidation -- the deterministic half of "dreaming".

Letta surfaces sleep-time compute as dreaming: background subagents that review
recent turns, consolidate what was learned, and rewrite memory without blocking
the foreground session. The consolidation is model work. The *trigger* is not --
it fires after a configured number of user messages, or on a context-compaction
event.

That split is the whole reason this file exists. OMH makes no model call, so it
cannot dream. It can decide precisely when dreaming is due, on what evidence,
and hand Hermes a prepared brief -- and Hermes already runs the consolidation
loop itself (``agent/background_review.py`` forks after each turn with the
memory and skill tools). The gap this closes is that the loop runs with no
statement of what is duplicated, expiring, or out of room. It supplies that.

Counting turns is deliberate and unglamorous. The sleep-time compute paper is
explicit that the technique pays off in proportion to how predictable the next
query is, so a scheduler that fires on a fixed interval should not be sold as
one that fires when consolidation would help most.

Stdlib only; vendored in the bundle because it is imported inside the Hermes
process, where the ``omh`` package does not exist.

"""What could be freed when Hermes' memory file has no room left.

Hermes enforces its cap by refusing the write. There is no eviction policy
behind it: the file fills, and the next thing worth remembering is simply lost.
MemGPT -- the architecture Letta grew from -- handles the same pressure with a
queue manager that evicts a fixed share of the oldest messages at a numeric
threshold, which is mechanical enough for a wrapper to reproduce.

Reproducing *oldest-first* is the part this deliberately does not do. Hermes
memory entries carry no timestamp, so "oldest" is unavailable, and position in
the file is not age. What is available is redundancy: two entries that restate
each other cost twice and are worth once. Those are proposed here.

Nothing else is. An entry that no OMH record explains is not thereby wrong --
it is unexplained, which is a reason to ask and not a reason to delete -- so it
is counted and left alone. The plan reports how far short the file is and what
is provably redundant; choosing what actually goes is the executor's, through
Hermes' own memory tool.

Metadata only: indices, character counts, similarity scores. Never entry text.
